## Hi, I'm Inayathullah

I’m a Senior Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience designing and delivering scalable, resilient, cloud-native systems using .NET and Azure.

I specialise in building high-throughput, event-driven architectures that power business-critical workflows across FinTech, Risk, Compliance, and PropTech domains.

Currently based in London, I’ve led and delivered platforms supporting hundreds of thousands of users and processing millions of records in production environments.

## What I Do

My work sits at the intersection of:

- **.NET (8/9/10) & C#**
- **Entity Framework Core & high-performance data access**
- **Microservices architecture**
- **Event-driven systems (Azure Service Bus, MassTransit, RabbitMQ)**
- **CQRS & Domain-Driven Design**
- **Cloud-native Azure solutions**
- **Observability-first engineering (OpenTelemetry, distributed tracing)**

I design systems that are:

- Scalable under load  
- Resilient by design  
- Observable in production  
- Evolvable without architectural decay

## Impact Highlights

Over the years, I’ve:

- Led architecture and delivery of multi-product underwriting platforms in the UK and US markets.
- Designed high-throughput decision engines processing **10K+ daily decisions** and **5M+ legacy records**.
- Built event-driven systems serving **250K+ customers**.
- Reduced compliance manual effort by **90%** through real-time automation.
- Modernised monolithic systems into Azure-native microservices.
- Established observability standards that significantly improved incident detection and recovery times.
- Led Landmark Information Group’s GBP10M geospatial platform modernization.

I care deeply about building systems that don’t just work — but continue to work under pressure.

## Engineering Philosophy

I believe:

- Simplicity scales better than cleverness  
- Observability is not optional  
- Architecture is about trade-offs, not trends  
- Reliability is a feature  
- Production is the ultimate truth  

Good engineering isn’t about frameworks — it’s about thinking clearly, modelling domains correctly, and designing for change.

## Why This Blog

This blog is my engineering notebook.

Here I write about:

- .NET and C# deep dives  
- Entity Framework performance patterns  
- System design decisions and trade-offs  
- Microservices lessons from production  
- Event-driven architecture insights  
- Performance tuning and observability  
- Interesting real-world debugging stories  

The goal is to share practical insights from real production systems — not theoretical patterns.

## Leadership & Collaboration

Beyond writing code, I:

- Lead architecture decisions  
- Mentor engineers  
- Promote TDD/BDD practices  
- Facilitate cross-functional collaboration  
- Translate regulatory and business requirements into scalable systems  

I enjoy working at the boundary between engineering, business logic, and system design.
